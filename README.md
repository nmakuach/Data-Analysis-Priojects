# Data-Analysis-Projects

Using SQL queries, I demonstrated my abilities in data exploration, data cleaning, and data virtualization.

In the first project, I explore data from "Our World in Data" https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases. The data contain Covid-19 total-cases,total population,total-vaccinated, total-death.
In the first project, I analyzed total_cases vs total_deaths and total cases vs population in Africa. I also look at the countries with the highest infection rates compared by population
countries with the highest death rate per population,total_death rate per continent,total population vs total vaccination,vacinatedPerecentage globally and also creating new tables for  RollingVacinatedpeople

The second project illustrates the data cleaning process in SQL. I used the Nashville housing data to  Standardize the Date Format, Populate Property Address data, Break out Addresses into Individual Columns (Address, City, State) and Change Y and N to Yes and No in the "Sold as Vacant" field.
The third project demonstrates data virtualization using tableau. I created dashboards using queries results from coviddeaths and covidvaccination
